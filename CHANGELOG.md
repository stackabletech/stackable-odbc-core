## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial extraction of `stackable-odbc-core` into its own repository.
  Provides the database-independent ODBC framework:
  protocol logic, handle allocation and tag validation, UTF-16 marshalling,
  diagnostics, panic safety, and the generic implementations of the ODBC FFI
  entry points, exported for a concrete backend via the `forward_ffi!` macro.
- `CursorBehavior` and the `SQL_CB_DELETE` / `SQL_CB_CLOSE` / `SQL_CB_PRESERVE`
  constants, modelling what `SQLEndTran` does to open cursors.
- `Backend::cursor_commit_behavior` and `Backend::cursor_rollback_behavior`.
  Both default to `CursorBehavior::Preserve`. A backend that supports
  transactions should declare its data source's actual behaviour here; the
  value drives both `SQLGetInfoW` and what `SQLEndTran` does to statements.
- `SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR` constant (23), derived from
  `odbc_sys::InfoType::CursorCommitBehaviour`.
- `StatementHandle::cursor_open`, plus the `set_result_set`,
  `set_prepared_statement` and `discard_result_set` helpers that maintain it.
  `StatementHandle::statement` no longer doubles as the answer to "is a cursor
  open?" — see the `Fixed` entry below.

### Changed

- `SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR` and `SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR` now report
  `SQL_CB_PRESERVE` instead of `SQL_CB_DELETE`, and are derived from
  `Backend::cursor_commit_behavior` / `Backend::cursor_rollback_behavior`
  rather than hard-coded. Core previously advertised `SQL_CB_DELETE` while
  `SQLEndTran` did nothing to cursors at all.
- The derivation now also covers backends that answer these two info types
  *nowhere*: `SQLGetInfoW`'s Driver-Manager-safe fallback reports the hooks
  instead of the generic shape default. Previously such a backend got
  `U16(0)` for `SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR` and `U32(0)` for
  `SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR` — both `SQL_CB_DELETE`, the second in the
  wrong shape — while `SQLEndTran` applied the declared behaviour.
- Under `SQL_CB_CLOSE`, `SQLEndTran` now closes each statement's cursor via
  `StatementBackend::close_cursor` and keeps the statement itself, instead of
  dropping it. The `SQLEndTran` statement transition table's footnote `[2]`
  leaves the prepared states S2/S3 unchanged; dropping the statement sent a
  prepared-but-never-executed statement back to the allocated state, so a
  subsequent `SQLNumResultCols` failed with `HY010` where the spec allows it.
  A backend declaring `CursorBehavior::Close` must implement `close_cursor`,
  which defaults to a no-op.
- Under `SQL_CB_DELETE`, `SQLEndTran` now also clears a pending
  data-at-execution sequence. It already cleared `param_count`, which
  `SQLParamData` uses to size its parameter vector, so a surviving sequence
  would have executed with zero parameters and silently discarded everything
  the application streamed via `SQLPutData`.
- **Breaking:** `default_get_info` and `common_get_info_raw` are now generic
  over the backend. Call them as `default_get_info::<Self>(info_type, widths)`
  and `common_get_info_raw::<Self>(info_type)` from a `Backend` impl.

### Fixed

- Cursor state is now tracked explicitly, by `StatementHandle::cursor_open`,
  instead of being inferred from `StatementHandle::statement`. Every `24000`
  check reads it: `SQLExecDirect`, `SQLGetData`, `SQLCloseCursor`, all ten
  catalog functions and `SQLSetStmtAttr` for
  `SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE` / `SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY` / `SQL_ATTR_SIMULATE_CURSOR` /
  `SQL_ATTR_USE_BOOKMARKS` / `SQL_ATTR_ROW_NUMBER`. Three behaviour changes
  follow:
  - After `SQLEndTran` under `SQL_CB_CLOSE`, `SQLExecDirect`, the catalog
    functions and those `SQLSetStmtAttr` attributes are accepted instead of
    returning `24000`. The statement transition table makes them legal
    (S4→S2, S5-S7→S3), but the statement is kept under `SQL_CB_CLOSE` and the
    old `statement.is_some()` guard read that as an open cursor.
  - `SQLCloseCursor` and `SQLGetData` now return `24000` on a statement that is
    only prepared, that executed without producing a result set, or whose
    cursor `SQLEndTran` closed under `SQL_CB_CLOSE`. They previously accepted
    all three, `SQLCloseCursor` reporting success with no cursor to close.
  - An execution that produces no result set (an `UPDATE`, say) no longer
    counts as an open cursor. A backend must report
    `StatementBackend::column_count` accurately as soon as
    `execute`/`exec_direct` returns — the same point `SQLNumResultCols` already
    reads it.
- `SQLEndTran` now applies the cursor behaviour the driver advertises. It
  previously reported `SQL_CB_DELETE` and left every cursor and prepared
  statement untouched, so an application that trusted the reported value
  operated on cursors it had been told were gone.
- `SQLEndTran` with `SQL_HANDLE_ENV` now attempts every connected connection
  on the environment instead of stopping at the first failure, and records a
  diagnostic on each failing connection so `SQLGetDiagRec` can identify it.
  A failure on one connection previously left every later connection holding
  an open transaction the application had asked to commit or roll back.
- `SQLEndTran` now clears diagnostics at entry — on the handle it was given,
  and on each connection it visits in the `SQL_HANDLE_ENV` loop. Without this,
  a record left by an earlier failed call on a connection that then committed
  fine made `SQLGetDiagRec` blame the wrong connection, defeating the
  per-connection diagnostics the spec tells applications to read.
- A corrupt entry in an environment's connection list no longer makes
  `SQLEndTran(SQL_HANDLE_ENV)` return `SQL_INVALID_HANDLE` for a call whose
  input handle was valid (and with no diagnostic record, since none is pushed
  for that variant). It now records a general error, so a genuinely failing
  connection's own SQLSTATE is no longer suppressed by a corrupt entry
  encountered before it.
